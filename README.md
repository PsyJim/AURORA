### What is DCViewer?
DCViewer borns as an intent of project of some undergrad astronomers. It is a graphical interface to display data cubes from distinct IFS (Integral Field Spectroscopy) telescopes as; MaNGa, MUSE and CALIFA.

### Why DCViewer?
We want to create a program that actually could be used to display and work with some distint data cubes. This due the lack of compatibility among the way that IFS telescope manage their data.

As the name says, it can display data cubes from differentes IFS telescopes. Also, we want to add some functions for the sake of data analysis.
